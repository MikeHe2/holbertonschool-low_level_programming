En este protyecto estaremos trabajando con las estructuras y typedef.


1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself.
    - Write a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog.

    - Define a new type struct dog with the following elements:

    - name, type = char *
    - age, type = float
    - owner, type = char *


2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life,
   things won't be too bad.

    - Write a function that prints a struct dog

    - Prototype: void print_dog(struct dog *d);
    - Format: see example bellow
    - You are allowed to use the standard library
    - If an element of d is NULL, print (nil) instead of this element. (if name is NULL, print Name: (nil))
    - f d is NULL print nothing.
